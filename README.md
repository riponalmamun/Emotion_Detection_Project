## Overview

This Emotion Detection Web App allows users to upload images and detect emotions from the faces in the images. The application integrates with the Luxand Emotion Recognition API, providing a simple and efficient way to identify emotions in images. This project demonstrates how to utilize FastAPI for the backend and JavaScript for frontend operations.

The app uses CORS middleware to ensure seamless interaction between the backend and frontend even when running on different ports. The frontend uses an image upload feature, and the backend processes the uploaded images, sends them to Luxand's API for emotion detection, and displays the results.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images directly from the web app.
- **Emotion Detection**: Automatically detects the dominant emotion in the image using Luxand API.
- **Frontend and Backend Separation**: CORS-enabled API for smooth communication between frontend and backend.
- **Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive error handling for both network and server issues.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**: 
  - FastAPI
  - Python 3.12+
  - Luxand API for emotion recognition
- **CORS Middleware**: Enables cross-origin requests from frontend to backend.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.12+ installed
- Node.js (if applicable for any other frontend tools)
- Access to the **Luxand Emotion Recognition API** (API key required).

### Setting up the Backend

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-web-app.git
    cd emotion-detection-web-app
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
    env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r app/requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the environment variables**:
    - Replace the API key in `main.py` for the Luxand API.
    - Make sure to configure the CORS `origins` correctly for your frontend URL.

    ```python
    LUXAND_API_KEY = "your_luxand_api_key"
    ```

5. **Run the FastAPI server**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

    Your backend should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Setting up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the `app` folder** and open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The app will load, allowing you to upload images and detect emotions.

### Usage
Start the backend:

Ensure that the backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 by executing the following command:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

###  Frontend:

Open the index.html in a web browser. You can now select an image file, click "Detect Emotion from Image," and see the dominant emotion and confidence level returned by the backend.
